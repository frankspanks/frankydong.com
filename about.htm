                        <p>My name is Franky Dong and I’m an aspiring Full Stack Engineer with a broad technical skill
                            set
                            and strong
                            attention to detail. I'm a passionate and willing learner with a continuous desire to build,
                            grow, and
                            excel.
                            I'm interested
                            in building large-scale web application systems based on cutting edge technologies,
                            services,
                            and APIs. In
                            addition to my engineering skills, I also have knowledge in cryptocurrency and blockchain
                            technology.</p>
                        <p>When I’m not programming, I’m hanging out with service dog <strong>Sushi</strong> (actually
                            always with her..) and working on my car projects.
                            I'm born and raised in San Jose but moved to San Francisco to study Computer Science at San
                            Francisco State University. I have had the fortunate pleasure of discovering the world with
                            my
                            A.D.H.D. I love sharing my learning experiences with others,
                            and hope to learn and teach as much as I can from this extraordinarily beautiful world that
                            we
                            all live in together.</p>

                                help me create amazing products. I realized that although I always knew I struggled
                                with programming and school because of my disabilities, they helped shaped my
                                character. I now see my disabilities as a driving force for growing and learning. I am
                                super excited to finish my Bachelors of Science @ San Francisco State University, and
                                start my

                                me discover my passion in Computer Science and little did I know it would be the spark
                                of something amazing. I learned how my educational failures contribute towards my
                                growth in software development. I took my now-girlfriend to our first crypto event
                                where I eventually fell in love with her and she showed me the road to develop my
                                passion in Computer Science (and helped me realize I needed glasses.. LOL).</p>

                                near-death-bed that his only dream was for me to graduate school. I was determined to
